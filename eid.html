        Eid is a religious festival that Muslims celebrate all over the world. It marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. On Eid, Muslims thank Allah for giving them strength and guidance. They wear new clothes, offer prayers, visit their friends and relatives, and exchange greetings. They also enjoy delicious food, especially sewaiyyan, a sweet dish made of vermicelli. Eid is a festival of joy, gratitude, and brotherhood. It brings people closer to each other and to God. Eid also teaches Muslims to be generous and compassionate to the poor and needy.
