        India, a country renowned for its vibrant culture and diverse
        traditions, is home to a plethora of festivals that reflect its rich
        heritage. These festivals, celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm,
        add color and vibrancy to the lives of its people. Indian festivals are
        a unique blend of religious, cultural, and social celebrations, making
        them an integral part of the nation's identity. India's religious
        festivals are a testimony to the country's spiritual diversity. Diwali,
        known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most widely celebrated
        festivals in India. It signifies the victory of light over darkness and
        good over evil. During Diwali, homes are adorned with oil lamps,
        colorful decorations, and fireworks light up the night sky. Families
        come together to exchange gifts, share sweets, and participate in
        prayers and rituals.
