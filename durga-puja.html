        Durga Puja is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of Goddess Durga over the demon Mahishasura. It is also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsav. It is mainly celebrated in Bengal, Assam and other eastern Indian states. It lasts for 10 days in the month of Ashvina (September-October). The first day is Mahalaya, which announces the arrival of the goddess. The next six days are devoted to worshipping Durga and her different forms as Lakshmi, Saraswati and others. The last day is Vijaya Dashami, when the idols of Durga are immersed in rivers or ponds. Durga Puja is a festival of joy, devotion and culture.
