        Holi is a festival of colours that Hindus celebrate in the month of March. It signifies the victory of good over evil and the arrival of spring. On Holi, people play with colours, water balloons, and pichkaris. They also light bonfires, sing songs, and dance. They visit their friends and relatives, and share sweets and snacks. Holi is a festival of joy, love, and harmony. It brings people closer to each other and to God. Holi also teaches people to forget their differences and forgive their enemies.
